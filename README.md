## What is PCG Tools?
 PCG Tools is a free PC software application for Korg (c) Music workstations/synthesizers. The application is capable of handling mainly PCG files. These files are used for programs, combis and set lists, global information and more. PCG Tools is mostly a librarian, but it also has some editor functions.
 
 More details are available at the PCG Tools website: http://pcgtools.mkspace.nl/
