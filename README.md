## What is PCG Tools?
 PCG Tools is a free PC software application for Korg (c) Music workstations/synthesizers. The application is capable of handling mainly PCG files. These files are used for programs, combis and set lists, global information and more. PCG Tools is mostly a librarian, but it also has some editor functions.
 
 More details are available at the PCG Tools website: http://pcgtools.mkspace.nl/

PCG Tools was written and owned by Michel Keijzers.    Although the main application is developed by Michael, he acknowledges the help of others in the sense of additional features (KorganizR), testing/info (McHale, Phinnin, JimKnopf, Cello, Cynkhy, Ppublicduende, rs.felicio, Mathieumaes, AdDeRoo, MattGerassimoff, CJ Johansson, Paul Hirschvogel, DanAtKorg, StevePavao and language support (Bernardo W., Francois Rossi, Jens, MarPabl, Mathieu, Rubens Felicio, Luis Costa, Yuma and Honza).
